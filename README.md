# My Developer Porfolio

This project is my Developer portfolio to showcase my projects and myself as a developer to potential clients and companies. This portfolio is my second version, and I used ReactJS and GatsbyJS as my primary technologies.

## About This Project

At first, I wasn't too happy with my first portfolio, so I decided to scrap the entire project and start over. I knew ReactJS already, but I wanted to challenge myself, so I picked GatsbyJS to learn more about it.

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

You might want to look into config.json to make change the port you want to use and set up a SSL certificate.
